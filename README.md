HTML/Javascript App for making short truth tables

This idea was created by Bram van Heulvn for his various logic classes.

The goal of this project is to have a working app that can save/load data, grade students' work, and give hints on how to make a short truth table.

To use the program, one can use the following operators and any choice of atomic statements:

LOGICAL NOT:           ~
LOGICAL AND:           &
LOGICAL OR:            |
LOGICAL CONDITIONAL:   > or (if you prefer Fitch style) %
LOGICAL BICONDITIONAL: = or $

You may create as many statements as you like using the + button and delete them with the - button.

Once you are satisfied with your result and you believe all your statements are syntactically correct,
you may press the submit button and they will be generated into a truth table form.  For any operators or atomic statements, you may place a "T" or a "F" to denote true and false for each of them.
