HTML/Javascript App for making short truth tables

This idea was created by Bram van Heuveln for his various logic classes.

The goal of this project is to have a working app that can save/load data, grade students' work, and give hints on how to make a short truth table.

NEW FEATURES:

Dropdown menu that allows selection of possible reasons for the next step in the table, and records them

Contradiction allows user to show that the value of an element in the tree contradicts another possible value
